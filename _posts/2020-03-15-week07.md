## Initial Thoughts on Open Source is Not About You
  Some main points that I thought were really captivating about his perspective, on open software, mainly detailed around independence and the freedom of contributing or not contributing on an open source software project. Not having strings attached is the center point throughout the article. It's refreshing and enjoyable the way Rich Hickey utilizes a passive/aggressive tone to detail certain gaps and misinterpretations of what open source software is. He details open source software,in such a way, that it cements this very raw and logical undertone throughout the post. He expresses it as, "Open source is a licensing and delivery mechanism". There is no obligation on any contributor whatsoever nor responsibilities. Everyone should have this freedom to express whatever they wish to express on an open source software project, regardless of any expectations from anyone. It is the canvas, our playground, where we the artists are allowed to paint whatever we sole desire. To strip away from this false communal infrastructure, is to relieve any external pressure or expectation one might hold from working on an open source software project. The very mechanisms behind the idea of open source software, Rich Hickey expresses, will in no doubt free the very seeded misconceptions and turn any pre-existing notions one might possibly have.

## Wiki Research:

**Pages I might be able to edit**

1. [Hunter College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_College)
2. [Bard High School Early College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bard_High_School_Early_College)
3. [The Flash (TV series)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flash_(2014_TV_series))

  Wikipedia is open source, which means that it is open to the public and anyone can make edits to it. However, this doesnt necessarily suggest that all the edits will cement and continue on. I imagine that there are people that edit and keep tabs on different edits to make sure they aren't missued. Infomation seems to be displayed along with links, that redirect you to the bottom of the page where it references that source of information. It is interesting to note that there is also a date and time at the bottom of wikipedia pages, that informs the user of the last edit. I also discovered that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization, which I had not previously known. It's pretty difficult to find a website that hasn't been recently updated with new information, or that lacks content. I think editing a recently created wiki page would be better than editing a wiki page that has been filtered a numerous amount of times. On the other spectrum, if you are looking in terms of grammatical mistakes then I do believe that there are wiki pages that gloss over grammatical mistakes.


## Issues in Depth:
  
 **A few of these issues are:**

Issues| Analysis | Design/Ideas? | Pathway(s)|
|---|:---|:---|:---|
|[Issue #1: Unsuscribe Link not working](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/38322)|Code for redirection might be at fault, some unmet edge cases, or something wrong with importing. | Testing whether it is an import database problem or a redirection problem.| freeCodeCamp/client/src/pages/unsubscribed.js or freeCodeCamp/client/src/client-only-routes/ShowUnsubscribed.js
|[Issue #2: Need to allow to use helper functions for the recursive challenges](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/37868) | A bug that doesn't allow helper functions to be used for recursive challenges|Some set of instructions that detect whether or not the user is using a helper function or not. A different sequence of instructions depending on what the user uses. | freeCodeCamp/curriculum/challenges/english/02-javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-recursion-to-create-a-countdown.english.md
|[Issue #3: Testing non-english challenges](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/34641) | There seems to be some ambiguity on the access of languages. In some places languages are specified, while in others they arent.|Format everything universally there should be a constant/similar format for language declaration throughout.| freeCodeCamp/curriculum/test/test-challenges.js
|[Issue #4: Allow username display to be case-insensitive](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/35525) | Conditions might not be sufficent to meet case-insensitive standards| Implement a case where a user could have lowercase or uppercase usernames. The computer has to essentially treat lowercase and uppercase the same way. They should be indistinguishable to the computer.| freeCodeCamp/client/src/components/settings/Username.js
|[Issue #5: Hash Table challenge test case](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/38049)|A bug that allows users to successfully complete the challenge without implementing the remove method.| There might be a flaw in how it is recieving the remove method or a possible edge case.|freeCodeCamp/ curriculum/challenges/english/08-coding-interview-prep/data-structures/create-a-hash-table.english.md


### Current Time-Table (Updated as of March 15,2020):

 Date| Small description 
|---|:---|
| 3/05/2020 | Picked out freeCodeCamp as the Open Source Software Development Project |

| 3/15/2020 | Reviewed issues (Analyzed and designed issues)|
   
**Future goals:**

[**********] = Fully Completed           |           [**........] = Partially completed

- [**********] Install the project 
- [***......] Refresh on Javascript
- [********..] Analyze and Design issues.
- [..........] Start creating scripts based off of issues.
- [..........] Debug scripts 
- [..........] Test scripts locally
- [..........] Modify and edit scripts based off of the API

### Contributions/Miscellaneous:
   
   I looked over some of freeCodeCamp's API and some of the code written in Javascript! I also forked, cloned, and edited [ElijahCanon33's blog](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/ElijahCano33-weekly/pull/5) and added a cafe/restaurant  into openstreetmaps.:)
